This is the last version released after his author, David (my brother), passed away on 2023.

 It's a simple catcher game.

 You have 2 modes of play : time mode and lives mode.

 In time mode you will play until time goes to 0.

 In lives mode you will play until no lives left.

 You have to catch tears (black and white).

 In time mode you can catch a clock for adding time.

 Black tear add two points to score, white add four points.

 Added animation of objects crashed.
