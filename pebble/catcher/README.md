 It's a simple catcher game.
 You have 2 modes of play : time mode and lives mode.
 In time mode you will play until time goes to 0.
 In lives mode you will play until no lives left.
 You have to catch tears (black and white).
 In time mode you can catch a clock for adding time.
 Black tear add two points to score, white add four points.
 Added animation of objects crashed.
 In lives mode there are five lives and for the moment there weren't added none while playing.
 It saves the 5 hightest score to pebble for every mode : 5 for lives mode and another 5 for time mode.
